Hello everyone!

This is the source code for my side project, where I attempt to build a mobile app for The University's Athletics. The app will focus on UI/UX methodology and best practices to create an optimized fan engagement experience.

This project currently only uses React Native to build the UI. The backend is still being figured out. This is a solo effort (for now).

I also made the prototype in Figma, in March 2024. Here is the link to the Figma file: https://www.figma.com/proto/HuXqbeMQNAQzjiVUdgNTYG/Tulsa-Hurricane-Mobile-App?page-id=95%3A6492&node-id=1006-1142&viewport=388%2C248%2C0.13&t=OSGGuKbTOknvDAKT-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=1006%3A1142

For now, no plan to actually publish this app on the app store, but to just practice my React Native skills, unless TU wants to collaborate to make this app a reality lol.
